# Codex Vitae

This Codex Vitae project started as a [coach.me course](https://betterhumans.coach.me/codex-vitae-635f97552092#.8ld2mxf91) that I signed up for to create my own. The original idea orignated from [Buster Benson](https://medium.com/u/5142451174a3), who got the idea from [Robin Sloan](https://medium.com/u/d3db58adb93a)'s book [Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FPOIT6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008FPOIT6&linkCode=as2&tag=mockerybird). 

As part of the course, we were recommended to copy a template to get started. And while I have very limited experience with GitHub, I decided to host my Codex Vitae here after being inspired by [Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md#codex-vitae)'s. Being able to track all revisions through branch commits is pretty sweet.

Side note to Ben: I tried to fork your Codex but it pulled your entire /public repository and there were a bunch of files that came with it. It was quite confusing so I just decided it would be easier to make my own. I really do have limited experience with GitHub :)

## Instructions

**If you are Jawn:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits.
3. At the beginning of every year archive the document.
4. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Jawn:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/jawnatron/public/commits/master/codex_vitae.md) for updates since you last visited.
3. Consider creating your own Codex ([here's a template](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md#codex-vitae))

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- It's always more interesting to be open minded.
- It's always more interesting to play devil's advocate about beliefs at least once.
- Try it out and come back after a while.

### Type 2: Principles
General guidelines for living.

- Never stop learning.
- There are always many ways to accomplish something but doing it efficiently makes you feel best.
- Focusing on a task at hand for 15 minutes to do something correctly is less taxing on the mind than having to waste 45 minutes to clean up a sloppily done task.
- "Controlled usage is not usually fatal and abstinence is not immortality." - Sherlock Holmes
